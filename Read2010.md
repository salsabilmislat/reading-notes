## Error Handling & Debugging

> If a JavaScript statement generates an error, then it throws an exception. At that point, the interpreter stops and looks for exception-handl ing code


***Error objects can help you find where your mistakes are and browsers have tools to help you read them.***

### Type of Error

  1. Error : Generic error - the other errors are all based upon this error
  2. Syntax Error : Syntax has not been followed
  3. Ref erenceError : Tried to reference a variable that is not declared/within scope 
  4. Type Error : An unexpected data type that cannot be coerced
  5. Range Error : Numbers not in acceptable range
  6. URI Error : encodeURI ().decodeURI(),and similar methods used incorrectly
  7.  Eval Error : eva l () function used incorrectly


### HOW TO DEAL WITH ERRORS
 
1. **DEBUG THE SCRIPT TO FIX ERRORS**
     
     If you come across an error while writing a script (or when someone reports a bug), you will need to debug the code, track down the source of the error, and fix it. 

2. **HANDLE ERRORS GRACEFULLY**

      You can handle errors gracefully using try, catch, throw, and f i na 1 ly statements.


>The JavaScript console will tell you when there is a problem with a script, where to look for the problem, and what kind of issue it seems to be.


*In the Sources: You can pause the execution of a script on any line using breakpoints. Then you can check the values stored in variables at that point in time.*

> You can create a breakpoint in your code using just the debugger keyword. When the developer tools are open, this will automatically create a breakpoint.
