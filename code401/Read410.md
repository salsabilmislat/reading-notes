## Stack

### What is a Stack

**Stack is a container of objects that are inserted and removed according to the last-in first-out (LIFO) principle.A data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.**

### Common terminology for a stack

1. push : put nodes in the stack

2. pop : delete or removed Nodes or items from the stack are popped

3. top : the top in the stack

4. peek : view the value of the top Node in the stack

5. IsEmpty : returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false

**That means if you want to push the last pushed node will be the top and if you want to pop the last one that you pushed wil be the first one to be poped**

**the first on pushed the next for it will be Null**

## Queue

### What is a Queue

**Queue is a container of objects (a linear collection) that are inserted and removed according to the first-in first-out (FIFO) principle.**


### Common terminology for a stack

1. Enqueue : put or add nodes in the queue

2. Dequeue : delete or removed Nodes or items from the queue 

3. Front : the Front /first Nodes or items in the queue

4. Rear : the last Node in the queue

5. Peek : view the value of the Front Node in the queue

6. IsEmpty : returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.

**That means if you want to Enqueue the first Added node will be the Front and if you want to Dequeue the first one that you Add wil be the first one to be delete or removed**

**The Rear which mean the last Node the next for it will be null**
