## What is a Graphs

**a graph is an abstract data type that is meant to implement the undirected graph and directed graph concepts from the field of graph theory within mathematics.**

### common terminology used when working with Graphs

1. Vertex - A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.

2. Edge - An edge is a connection between two nodes.

3. Neighbor - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.

4. Degree - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.

### Directed vs Undirected

### Undirected Graphs

**is a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction.**

### Directed Graph

**a set of objects (called vertices or nodes) that are connected together, where all the edges are directed from one vertex to another. A directed graph is sometimes called a digraph or a directed network.**
