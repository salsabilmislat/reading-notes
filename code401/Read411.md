## Jupyter

### what is JupyterLab ?

**JupyterLab is a web-based interactive development environment for Jupyter notebooks, code, and data. JupyterLab is flexible: configure and arrange the user interface to support a wide range of workflows in data science, scientific computing, and machine learning.**


**JupyterLab also offers a unified model for viewing and handling data formats. JupyterLab understands many file formats (images, CSV, JSON, Markdown, PDF, Vega, Vega-Lite, etc.) and can also display rich kernel output in these formats.**

## NumPy

### NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. 


### Numpy 2-Dimensional Arrays

**2D array are also called as Matrices which can be represented as collection of rows and columns.**


### Alternative NumPy Array Creation Methods

**It’s useful to create an array with all zero elements in cases when you need an array of fixed size, but don’t have any values for it yet.**

### Indexing NumPy Arrays

**Array indexing is the same as accessing an array element. You can access an array element by referring to its index number. The indexes in NumPy arrays start with 0, meaning that the first element has index 0, and the second has index 1 etc.**

### Slicing NumPy Arrays

**You can slice a numpy array is a similar way to slicing a list - except you can do it in more than one dimension. As with indexing, the array you get back when you index or slice a numpy array is a view of the original array. It is the same data, just accessed in a different order.**

### NumPy Data Types

1. float: numeric floating point data.

2. int: integer data.

3. string: character data.

4. object: Python objects.


### Single Array Math

The basic mathematical operations (/, *, -, +, ^) with an array and a value, it will apply the operation to each of the elements in the array.


### Multiple Array Math

It is possible to do mathematical operations between arrays
