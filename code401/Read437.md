## ES6 Syntax and Feature Overview

**ES6 brought significant changes to the JavaScript language. It introduces several new features such as, block-scoped variables, new loop for iterating over arrays and objects, template literals, and many other enhancements to make JavaScript programming easier and more fun.**

## Tailwind CSS


+ Tailwind’s flexbox and padding utilities (`flex`, `flex-shrink-0`, and `p-6`) to control the overall card layout
+ The max-width and margin utilities (`max-w-sm `and `mx-auto`) to constrain the card width and center it horizontally
+ The background color, border radius, and box-shadow utilities (bg-white, rounded-xl, and shadow-md) to style the card’s appearance
+ The width and height utilities (`w-12` and `h-12`) to size the logo image
+ The space-between utilities (`space-x-4`) to handle the spacing between the logo and the text
+ The font size, text color, and font-weight utilities (`text-xl`, `text-black`, `font-medium`, etc.) to style the card text


## Next.js

**To build a complete web application with React from scratch, there are many important details you need to consider:**

- Code has to be bundled using a bundler like webpack and transformed using a compiler like Babel.
- You need to do production optimizations such as code splitting.
- You might want to statically pre-render some pages for performance and SEO. You might also want to use server-side rendering or client-side rendering.
- You might have to write some server-side code to connect your React app to your data store.

## Next.js: The React Framework
Next.js aims to have best-in-class developer experience and many built-in features, such as:

- An intuitive page-based routing system (with support for dynamic routes)
- Pre-rendering, both static generation (SSG) and server-side rendering (SSR) are supported on a per-page basis
- Automatic code splitting for faster page loads
- Client-side routing with optimized prefetching
- Built-in CSS and Sass support, and support for any CSS-in-JS library
- Development environment with Fast Refresh support
- API routes to build API endpoints with - Serverless Functions
- Fully extendable
