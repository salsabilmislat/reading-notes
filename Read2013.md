## Local Storage For Web Applications

> HTML5 Storage is a specification named Web Storage, which was at one time part of the HTML5 specification proper, but was split out into its own specification for uninteresting political reasons. Certain browser vendors also refer to it as “Local Storage” or “DOM Storage.” The naming situation is made even more complicated by some related, similarly-named, emerging standards that I’ll discuss later in this chapter.


### you can use Modernizr to detect support for HTML5 Storage.

     if (Modernizr.localstorage) {
    // window.localStorage is available!
    } else {
    // no native support for HTML5 storage :(
     // maybe try dojox.storage or a third-party solution
    }


***The named key is a string. The data can be any type supported by JavaScript, including strings, Booleans, integers, or floats. However, the data is actually stored as a string. If you are storing and retrieving anything other than strings, you will need to use functions like parseInt() or parseFloat() to coerce your retrieved data into the expected JavaScript datatype.***


**If you want to keep track programmatically of when the storage area changes, you can trap the storage event. The storage event is fired on the window object whenever setItem(), removeItem(), or clear() is called and actually changes something.**


***STORAGEEVENT OBJECT***

1. key 

   - type:string	  

   - the named key that was added, removed, or modified

2. oldValue

	- any	
    
    - the previous value (now overwritten), or null if a new item was added

3. newValue

	- any	
    - the new value, or null if an item was removed

4. url	
    - string	
    - the page which called a method that triggered this change
