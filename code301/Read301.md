## Component-Based Architecture

### What is a component?

>A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface.

**A component can have three different views:**

1. object-oriented view : is viewed as a set of one or more cooperating classes. Each problem domain class (analysis) and infrastructure class (design) are explained to identify all attributes and operations that apply to its implementation.

2. conventional view

3. process-related view

### What are the charactistics of a component?

1. Reusability : designed to be reused in different situations in different applications.

2. Replaceable : freely substituted with other similar components.

3. Not context specific : designed to operate in different environments and contexts.

4. Extensible : can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.

5. Encapsulated : allow the caller to use its functionality, and do not expose details of the internal processes or any internal variables or state.

6. Independent : designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.

### What are the advantages of using component based architecture?

1. Ease of deployment : it is easier to replace existing versions with no impact on the other components or the system as a whole.

2. Reduced cost : The use of third-party components allows you to spread the cost of development and maintenance.

3. Ease of development : provide defined functionality, allowing development without impacting other parts of the system.

4. Reusable : they can be used to spread the development and maintenance cost across several applications or systems.

5. Modification of technical complexity : modifies the complexity through the use of a component container and its services.

6. Reliability : reliability increases since the reliability of each individual component enhances.

7. System maintenance and evolution : Easy to change and update the implementation without affecting the rest of the system.

8. Independent : Independency and flexible connectivity of components

## React JS

### What is props short for?

 It is the way to pass data between components in other word is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another.

### How are props used in React?

It has three basic steps:

1. Firstly, define an attribute and its value(data)

    **We can define our own attributes & assign values with interpolation { } so it will has a property and a value:**

2. Then pass it to child component(s) by using Props

    it is the same way of passing arguments to a function, we  can pass props into a React component and props bring all the necessary data.

3. Finally, render the Props Data

    as a final the Props returns back an object so we can  access to object elements with dot

## Things I want to know more about

i want to know more about how i can use react function more in my code.
I am curios more about how to use react in mathmatic examples.
