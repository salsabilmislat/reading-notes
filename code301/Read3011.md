## SQL vs NoSQL Database

**Five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:**

| SQL     | NoSQL |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| databases are primarily called as Relational Databases | database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database. |
| represent data in form of tables which consists of n number of rows of data  |databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores |
| have predefined schema | have dynamic schema for unstructured data |
|  vertically scalable (caled by increasing the horse-power of the hardware) |horizontally scalable (scaled by increasing the databases servers in the pool of resources to reduce the load) |
|( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data | queries are focused on collection of documents |

**What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?**

1. the complex query intensive environment

2. heavy duty transactional type applications, as it is more stable and promises the atomicity as well as integrity of the data

**What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?**

1. the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data.

2. Semi-structured or Unstructured data / flexible schema

3. Limited pre-defined access paths and query patterns

4. No complex queries, stored procedures, or views

5. High velocity transactions

**Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?**

MongoDB, and Redis are great for small scale, hierarchical data with a relatively small amount of children for each entry.

**Which type of database is best for scalability?**

database type use is the combination of MySQL and MongoDB.

**What does SQL stand for?**

Structured Query Language

**What is a realational database?**

 is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another.

**What type of structure does a relational database work with?**

1. one-to-one

2. one-to-many

3. many-to-many

**What is a ‘schema’?**

is its structure described in a formal language supported by the database management system (DBMS). The term "schema" refers to the organization of data as a blueprint of how the database is constructed (divided into database tables in the case of relational databases).

**What is a NoSQL database?**

 "not only SQL" are non tabular, and store data differently than relational tables. NoSQL databases come in a variety of types based on their data model. The main types are document, key-value, wide-column, and graph. They provide flexible schemas and scale easily with large amounts of data and high user loads.

**What is inside of a Mongo database?**

 MongoDB stores data records as documents (specifically BSON documents) which are gathered together in collections. A database stores one or more collections of documents.

**Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.**

 MongoDB more flexible.

MongoDB stores data in JSON format with key and value pairs for each entity whereas SQL Databases stores data as a record in a row of the table.
