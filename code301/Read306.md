## Pair Programming

**What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?**

1. Greater efficiency

2. Engaged collaboration

3. Learning from fellow students

4. Social skills

5. Job interview readiness

6. Work environment readiness

**In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?**

These three reasons:

1. Greater efficiency: when two people focus on the same code base, it is easier to catch mistakes in the making, also produces higher-quality code.

2. Engaged collaboration: he experience is more engaging and both programmers are more focused than if they were working alone.

3. Learning from fellow students:working with a teammate can expose developers to techniques they otherwise would not have thought of.

**How does pair programming work?**

pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer.
