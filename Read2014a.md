# What we will learn 



1. the transform property can be revisited with alternative ways to size, position, and change elements. All of these new techniques are made possible by the transform.

2. The transform property accepts a handful of different values. The rotate value provides the ability to rotate an element from 0 to 360 degrees. Using a positive value will rotate an element clockwise, and using a negative value will rotate the element counterclockwise.

3. the scale value within the transform property allows you to change the appeared size of an element. 
   - The scaleX value will scale the width of an element 
    - The scaleY value will scale the height of an element.
    -  To scale both the height and width of an element but at different sizes, the x and y axis values may be set simultaneously. To do so, use the scale transform declaring the x axis value first, followed by a comma, and then the y axis value.

4. TO add Animation: To set multiple points at which an element should undergo a transition, use the @keyframes rule. The @keyframes rule includes the animation name, any animation breakpoints, and the properties intended to be animated.
