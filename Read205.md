## Images

   >A picture can say a thousand words, and great images help make the difference between an average-looking site and a really engaging one.


- keeping images in a separate folder helps you understand how the site is organized.

- Adding Images using  the img tag  [img src="the image url " alt="to read img for the one who can not see it" title="title for img" /]

- Three Rules for Creating Images :

    - Save images in the right format
    - Save images at the right size
    - Use the correct resolution

- HTML5 has introduced a new [figure] element to obtain images and their caption so that the two are associated.

## Colors

 > Color can really bring your pages to life.

- You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:
  
   - rgb values : These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up. For example: rgb(100,100,90)
   
   - hex codes These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash # sign. For example: #ee3e80

   - color names There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers. For example: Dark Cyan

- the background-color property sets the color of the background for that box.

## Text

- font-family : allows you to specify the typeface that should be used for any text inside the element(s) to which a CSS rule applies.

- font-size: Pixels are commonly used because they allow web designers very precise control over how much space their text takes up. The number of pixels is followed by the letters px.

- font-weight: normal  -- bold

- font-style: normal -- italic -- oblique

- text-transform: uppercase -- lowercase -- capitalize

- text-decoration: none -- underline -- overline -- line-through -- blink 

- text-align: left -- right -- center -- justify
