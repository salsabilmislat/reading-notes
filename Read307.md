## REST

**Who is Roy Fielding?**

He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet, he did a lot of research explaining why the web works the way it does.

**Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?**

>Because they weren't designed to be used like that. When Fielding and his colleagues started building the web, being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern. But most of the techniques developers later used to get computers to talk to each other didn't have those requirements. You just needed to talk to a small group of machines.

**What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?**

is all about applying verbs to nouns, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.

**What does a GET do?**

GET stuff using the HTTP protocol on them until all the resources are obtained and the web page is displayed.

**What does a POST do?**
It used If one system needs to add something to another system.

**What does PUT do?**
It used If a system wants to replace something in another system.

**What does PATCH do?**
It used to do a partial update
