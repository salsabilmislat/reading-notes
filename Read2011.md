## Images

> You can control the size of an image using the width and height properties in CSS, just like you can for any other box.

1. The float property is added to the class that was created to represent the size of the image (such as the small class in our example).

2. New classes are created with names such as align-left or align-right to align the images to the left or right of the page. These class names are used in addition to classes that indicate the size of the image.

3. The background-image property allows you to place an image behind any HTML element. This could be the entire page or just part of the page. By default, a background image will repeat to fill the entire box.

**background-repeat**

1. repeat : The background image is repeated both horizontally and vertically (the default way it is shown if the backgroundrepeat property isn't used).

2. repeat-x : The image is repeated horizontally only (as shown in the first example on the left).

3. repeat-y : The image is repeated vertically only

4. background-position : 

        - left top
        - left center
        - left bottom
        - center top
        - center center
        - center bottom
        - right top
        - right center
        - right bottom

5. To reduce the number of images your browser has to load, you can create image sprites.

## Practical Information

  >Search engine optimization (or SEO) is the practice of trying to help your site appear nearer the top of search engine results when people look for the topics that your website covers.

    - Page Title
    -  URL / Web Address
    - Headings
    - Text

- Organize : Group the keywords into separate lists for the different sections or categories of your website.

- Search engine optimization helps visitors find your sites when using search engines.

- Analytics tools such as Google Analytics allow you to see how many people visit your site, how they find it, and what they do when they get there.

- To put your site on the web, you will need to obtain a domain name and web hosting.

- FTP programs allow you to transfer files from your local computer to your web server.

- Many companies provide platforms for blogging, email newsletters, e-commerce and other popular website tools (to save you writing them from scratch).
