# **what is Growth mindset?**

*A growth mindset is pepole who believe their talents ,intelegent and understand that their abilities can be developed through*
 - hard working
 - good strategies 
 - a desire to learn 
 
 which mean how much you give you will take. so we should keep in mind that you are the only one who is responsible for your mind you could leave it idle 😑  or develop it 🧐 . 
 ## for myself to keep  in a growth mindset
 1. never gave up
 2. put more effort
 3. explore more and more
